This version makes a scoop and bake type of cookie that is rolled in sugar to give it texture. To make decorated cookies, roll the dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness and chill the dough 20 mins. before cutting and baking.</p><ol><li>Adjust oven rack to middle position, preheat to <strong>350&deg; F</strong> and line 2 cookie sheets with parchment paper.</li><li>Combine butter, sugar, baking powder, kosher salt, and vanilla extract in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low for 2 mins. to bring the mixture together and then increase to medium and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 mins. Add the egg and continue beating another 2 mins. until smooth. Stop the beater and scrape the bowl. Mix on low, and spoon in the flour one spoonful at a time and continue to mix until the dough is formed.</li><li>Divide into whatever cookie size you choose, and roll into balls. Dredge cookie balls in granulated sugar and place on prepared cookie sheets, leave some room for the cookies to spread. You do not need to flatten these, the cookies will spread on their own. If cut out cookies are made, arrange onto tray without granulated sugar.</li><li>Bake until the edges turn golden, about 15 mins. Decorate as desired!</li></ol></div><div class="row column"><h2 class="submissions-carousel__header submissions-carousel__header--print">Share your Iowa cookie creations with us:<br>greeting.president.uiowa.edu</h2><footer class="footer footer--print row expanded"><div class="large-12 columns"><img class="footer__logo footer__logo--print" src="mysite/dist/images/uiowa.png" alt="The University of Iowa"></div><p class="text-center">Card design by the Division of Student Life Marketing + Design<br>Cookie design by Jacky Mills - UI Center for Advancement</p></footer></div></article>
